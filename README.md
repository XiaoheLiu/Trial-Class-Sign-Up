# Trial Class Sign Up Form

A survey form for signing up for trial classes.
This page is inspired by a real-world sword play introductory course at [Academie Duello](https://www.academieduello.com/school/forms/trial-sign-up/).

This page showcases my skills to:
- Create forms using various type of HTML input;
- Use media query to accomodate different screen sizes;
- Use CSS @keyframes to create animations.

See a demo of the full page at [codepen](https://codepen.io/sd_athena/pen/QZWvXP).

This is one of the five projects that I did for the Responsive Web Design Certificate at freeCodeCamp.org : "[Build a Survey Form](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)".
